# Uncommon HTML Bug: Incorrectly Hiding a Div Element

This repository demonstrates a subtle bug in HTML involving the incorrect hiding of a div element after its content is updated.  The bug occurs because the `style.display` property is set to `none` and then immediately back to `block` in quick succession, which doesn't allow the browser to render the changed content effectively, making the div disappear unexpectedly. 

## Bug Description

A div element's content is updated using JavaScript's `innerHTML`. However, setting its `style.display` to "none" and then immediately to "block" prevents the updated content from being displayed. This results in the div element appearing empty or hidden after the button click, even though the content has been technically updated.

## Solution

The solution involves a slight adjustment to the JavaScript code. Instead of setting `style.display` to `none` and immediately back to `block`, a small delay is introduced using `setTimeout` which allows the browser to render the changes before attempting to show the element again.
